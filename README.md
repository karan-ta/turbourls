new project - work in progress mode.
currently - nothing here to use.

How the website will work :
how the site will work.

prolific programmer on github - will add a link that helped him in his learning process.
we can crawl reddit,github  to seed content.

other prolific programmers will approve links.

all programmers will push their links,approvals to github.

our static site generator will collect the links,approvals and generate the site that has design  like faburls.com

once we get traffic - we will allow anyone to push a job,project ,( recommendations to the job ) -  by paying  bitcoin  to the network.

all developers, contributors, approvers will be paid bitcoin automatically via - a smart contract we will create.

so it will be awesome side income for programmers and a great learning/tutorial  links bookmarking service for programmers.

Start contributing today - create an issue with your ideas/thoughts and start sending PR :) 
we are very open to learning, new ideas.

cheers!
